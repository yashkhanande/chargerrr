Chargerrr App

This app is built to find nearby charging stations.

Requirements

Mapbox Access Token
To use the map features, you need a valid Mapbox ACCESS_TOKEN.

Running the Project

If you are using Android Studio or the terminal, run your app like this:

flutter run -d <device_id> --dart-define=ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>


Replace <device_id> with your device ID (e.g., from flutter devices) and <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> with your Mapbox token.
